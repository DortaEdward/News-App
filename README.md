# News App
This web application was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and the Newsapi.

## Purpose of the Application
I haven't used an api with a express server so I wanted to give it a go. Another reason for the creation of this application was to be able to go to one site and see multiple articles at once. A later update of the application will allow the user to choose what kind of articles they would like to see.

## User Story
* Whenever the page is loaded, the server makes a api call to Newsapi and gets a object with articles and updates the cards on the ejs page with current articles.
